    { type: 'paragraph', content: `As a contractor for Clinkle, I was tasked with designing and building a prototype for a landing page for the mobile app Treats. The goal of the website was to maximize user comprehension of our product (which was very unique) and to push a new video which was in production at the time. Because the app is complex, I decided to explain the process one step at a time, in order to show the lifecycle of a "treat" and simultaneously explain what the app could do for you. I worked closely with Clinkle's motion designer Craig Avanzino, and incorprated videos of the app into the website which worked great! I refined the design over several weeks by showing new users this prototype and listening to their comments. This project involved deep collaboration with our marketing team, web team and other design team members and I am thrilled with the results.` }
